> *"Melos contra mundum"* - Music against the world

**Discover the stories behind the music. Embark on an exquisite musical odyssey.**

TuneTales is a revolutionary music storytelling platform that creates intimate connections between fans and artists through immersive, educational experiences. We're building the "Disney+ of music stories" - where every song has a universe of stories waiting to be explored.

## ✨ Vision

TuneTales reimagines how people experience music. This isn't a streaming app - it's an immersive storytelling engine that fuses:

- 🎭 **Deep artist backstories** and song origin tales
- 🎨 **Interactive storytelling cards** that guide users through lyrics, meanings, and cultural context
- 🌈 **Mood-reactive visual design** that adapts to the emotional tone of each story
- 🔊 **Audio-synchronized storytelling** using curated clips and ambient soundscapes
- 💫 **Hyper-personalized journeys** that feel like private concerts with the artists themselves

Think: **Disney+ storytelling quality** + **Spotify's personalization** + **Apple Music's design polish**, but for music narratives instead of music streaming.
