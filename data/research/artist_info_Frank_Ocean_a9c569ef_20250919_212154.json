Below is a comprehensive profile tailored for an immersive storytelling experience.\n\n---\n\n## 1. BIOGRAPHY & EARLY LIFE\n\n- **Birth date, location, family background:**  \n  Frank Ocean was born **Christopher Edwin Breaux** on **October 28, 1987**, in **Long Beach, California**. His father, Calvin Cooksey, was a singer and keyboardist, and his mother, Katonya Breaux Riley, is an entrepreneur. His parents divorced when he was six, and he was primarily raised by his mother[1].\n\n- **Childhood influences and early musical exposure:**  \n  Ocean’s early years were shaped by his family’s move to **New Orleans, Louisiana** when he was five. He was raised Christian and spent some time as a practicing Catholic. His grandfather, Lionel McGruder Jr., a recovering addict and mentor at AA/NA meetings, became a father figure and exposed him to stories of struggle and redemption—experiences that later inspired songs like “Crack Rock” and “There Will Be Tears”[1].\n\n- **Education and formative experiences:**  \n  Ocean graduated from **John Ehret High School** in Marrero, Louisiana, in 2005. He enrolled at the **University of New Orleans** to study English, but **Hurricane Katrina** destroyed his home and recording studio in August 2005, forcing him to transfer to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He soon dropped out to pursue music full-time[1].\n\n- **Key events that shaped artistic vision:**  \n  The trauma of Hurricane Katrina, the loss of his home, and his grandfather’s mentorship deeply influenced Ocean’s worldview and songwriting, instilling themes of loss, resilience, and longing[1].\n\n---\n\n## 2. MUSICAL CAREER TIMELINE\n\n- **Career beginnings and breakthrough moments:**  \n  After moving to Los Angeles post-Katrina, Ocean worked odd jobs to fund studio time, eventually selling his first song at 19. He wrote for artists like Brandy, John Legend, and Justin Bieber.

His lyrics became increasingly introspective and abstract over time[1][2].\n\n- **Label history and business decisions:**  \n  Initially signed to Def Jam, Ocean famously fulfilled his contract with the visual album *Endless* before releasing *Blonde* independently, a move widely regarded as a masterstroke in artist autonomy[1].\n\n---\n\n## 3.
